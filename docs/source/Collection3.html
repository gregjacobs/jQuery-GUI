</span>	 * @class data.Collection
	 * @extends data.DataComponent
	 * 
	 * Manages an ordered set of {@link data.Model Models}. This class itself is not meant to be used directly, 
	 * but rather extended and configured for the different collections in your application.
	 * 
	 * Ex:
	 *     
	 *     myApp.Todos = Collection.extend( {
	 *         model: myApp.Todo

	 * 
	 * ### Model Events
	 * 
	 * Collections automatically relay all of their {@link data.Model Models'} events as if the Collection
	 * fired it. The collection instance provides itself in the handler though. For example, Models' 
	 * {@link data.Model#event-change change} events:
	 *     
	 *     var Model = Model.extend( {
	 *         attributes: [ 'name' ]

	 *         model2 = new Model( { name: &quot;Josh&quot; } );
	 *     var collection = new Collection( [ model1, model2 ] );
	 *     collection.on( 'change', function( collection, model, attributeName, newValue, oldValue ) {
	 *         console.log( &quot;A model changed its '&quot; + attributeName + &quot;' attribute from '&quot; + oldValue + &quot;' to '&quot; + newValue + &quot;'&quot; );
	 *     } );
